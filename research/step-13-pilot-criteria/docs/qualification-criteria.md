## Pilot-Specific Criteria

### Must-Haves for First 3-5 Partners

- [x] MAU: 25K-150K (enough for meaningful results, not too complex)
- [x] Current revenue: <$1K/month (clear upside opportunity)
- [x] D30 retention: >25% (proves product-market fit)
- [x] Technical complexity: Tier 1 (8-16 on scorecard)
- [x] Single platform focus (iOS OR Android, not both)
- [x] Non-gaming category (utilities, productivity, education, lifestyle)
- [x] Solo developer or team of 2 max
- [x] Not VC-backed or venture-funded
- [x] Willing to share full analytics access
- [x] Responds to initial outreach within 7 days
- [x] Can implement tracking code/SDK
- [x] Available for weekly 30-min sync calls
- [x] Willing to sign 60-day pilot agreement

### Nice-to-Haves for Pilot

- [ ] Warm introduction or existing relationship
- [ ] iOS-primary (5.4x higher subscription ARPU)
- [ ] App in top categories: productivity, utilities, education
- [ ] Developer has technical blog/Twitter presence (social proof)
- [ ] App has 4.0+ star rating
- [ ] App updated within last 90 days
- [ ] Developer timezone overlap with US (easier sync calls)
- [ ] Previous experience with analytics tools
- [ ] Existing but underoptimized monetization (ads or freemium)

---

## Minimum Thresholds (Must Pass)

- [ ] MAU >= 25,000 (raised from 15K for pilot phase)
- [ ] Not VC-backed
- [ ] Solo dev or small team (<3 for pilot)
- [ ] Non-gaming category
- [ ] No major legal/compliance risks
- [ ] Developer willing to sign revenue share agreement
- [ ] Tier 1 or Tier 2 complexity (reject Tier 3)

---

## Disqualifiers (Deal-Breakers)

### Automatic Rejection
- App has significant IP/trademark issues
- App requires ongoing content creation (news, social feeds)
- Core functionality depends on expensive third-party APIs (>$500/mo)
- Developer has negative reputation in community
- Red flag features present (see Step 8):
  - Real-time multiplayer
  - User-generated content with moderation
  - Video/photo editing
  - Offline-first with sync
  - Social networking features
  - Complex e-commerce/marketplace
  - HIPAA/PCI compliance requirements

### Pilot-Specific Deal-Breakers
- Wants guaranteed minimum payment upfront (we provide floor during pilot, not guarantee)
- Refuses to share analytics access
- Expects 10x revenue growth in 30 days (unrealistic)
- Won't commit to weekly sync calls
- Asks for extensive free proof-of-work before signing
- Direct competitor to existing portfolio app
- Primarily interested in knowledge transfer vs. partnership
- Poor communication (ghosts, misses scheduled calls)
- App not updated in 6+ months (may indicate abandonment)

| Growth | 65/35 | None after proving 2x revenue | 6+ months |
| Scale | 60/40 | None | Ongoing |

└── YES → Is app non-gaming?
    ├── NO → REJECT (out of scope)
    └── YES → Is developer responsive (<7 days)?
        ├── NO → NURTURE (re-engage in 30 days)
