## Quick Reference

| Persona | Fit Score | Tagline | Partnership Openness |
|---------|-----------|---------|---------------------|
| The Burned Out Solo Dev | **Best Fit** | "I just want my life back" | High |
| The Accidental Success | Good Fit | "I built this for myself and somehow people love it" | Medium |
| The Aspiring Entrepreneur | Selective Fit | "I'm building a business, not just an app" | Medium-Low |
| The Emerging Market Builder | Good Fit | "My app has users but the geography kills revenue" | Medium-High |

**Key Insight:** Autonomy is the #1 driver of developer satisfaction. Any partnership must preserve developer control over technology and creative decisions.

**Demographic Context (from Stack Overflow, JetBrains surveys):**
- ~50% of developers experiencing burnout symptoms
- 82% primarily self-taught via online resources
- 72% male, 28% female
- Primary age range: 28-42 for side project developers
- 10-20 hours/week typical side project time investment

---

## Persona 1: The Burned Out Solo Dev

**Tagline:** "I just want my life back."

**Fit Score:** Best — Most open to partnership, values freedom over control.

### Demographics
- **Age:** 28-42 years old
- **Location:** US, UK, Germany, major tech hubs
- **Employment:** Full-time software engineer ($80-150K salary)
- **Experience:** 5-10 years professional development
- **App development:** Side project, 1-3 years old

### Their App
- **Category:** Productivity, utility, or lifestyle
- **Users:** 50K-300K MAU
- **Revenue:** $0-500/month (under-monetized)
- **Tech stack:** React Native, Flutter, or native
- **Update frequency:** Slowing (every 2-3 months)
- **Tech debt:** Moderate to high

### Psychographics

**Values:**
- Work-life balance above all
- Freedom and flexibility
- Quality craftsmanship
- Their users' satisfaction

**Fears:**
- Being trapped in obligation forever
- Disappointing users who depend on the app
- Partnership demanding MORE work, not less
- Getting scammed or exploited

**Aspirations:**
- Passive income stream
- Freedom from maintenance burden
- Recognition for what they built
- Time for something new (or nothing at all)

### Pain Points (Ranked)
1. **Mental exhaustion** — Day job depletes energy for side project
2. **Maintenance burden** — Support tickets, bug fixes, OS updates
3. **Guilt cycle** — Can't abandon users, can't keep up
4. **Monetization confusion** — Don't know how to turn users into revenue
5. **Scaling fear** — Growth would break them further

### Key Quote
> "After intense cognitive work, finding energy for side projects is difficult... The transition from enjoyment to dread signals unsustainability."
> — Developer on Dev.to

### Decision Triggers

**Say YES when:**
- "Set it and forget it" promise
- Minimal time commitment (2 hrs/month max)
- Partner handles ALL operations
- Fair revenue share with transparent reporting
- Easy exit clause if partnership doesn't work

**Say NO when:**
- Required to do more development work
- IP transfer or ownership changes
- Complex, long-term contracts
- Vague terms or hidden costs
- High-pressure sales tactics

### Messaging Approach

**Lead with:** "You've been carrying this alone for too long. Hand off the burden and get your life back."

**Emphasize:** Freedom from operations, passive income, we handle everything, no-strings exit clause.

**Avoid:** Development commitments, implying they should do more, complex structures, regular meetings.

### Where to Find Them
- r/androiddev, r/iOSProgramming (lurking, rarely posting)
- Indie Hackers (reading, not posting)
- Apps with declining update frequency but steady users
- Twitter/X following indie dev accounts

### Decision Timeline
2-4 weeks once trust established. Burnout accelerates decisions.

---

- Alienating loyal users
- Being taken advantage of by business people
- Losing creative control of "their baby"

**Aspirations:**
- Modest passive income without changing the app's soul

- Learning how business actually works

### Pain Points (Ranked)
1. **Monetization paralysis** — Don't know where to start
2. **Fear of backlash** — Users might hate ads/subscriptions
3. **Business skill gap** — Marketing, analytics, pricing are foreign
4. **Time constraints** — Can't learn business AND maintain app
5. **Imposter syndrome** — "Who am I to charge for this?"

### Key Quote
> "I cannot find time to develop this more (and also market it honestly) so I've decided to sell... I really liked working on this one project."
> — CodeOx on Indie Hackers (750+ monthly visitors, no monetization)

### Decision Triggers

- Track record with similar apps

**Say NO when:**

## Universal Trust Signals

What ALL developers look for before partnering:

### Must-Haves (Non-Negotiable)

1. **Developer retains 100% IP ownership** — Even 50/50 IP splits are unacceptable
2. **Proven track record** — Case studies with specific numbers, not just "we helped X clients"
3. **Transparent terms** — Clear revenue definitions, payment schedules, no hidden costs
4. **Responsive communication** — Quick, clear responses during negotiation
5. **Verifiable identity** — Real business, LinkedIn profiles, public presence

### Green Flags

- Revenue share model (not IP purchase)
- Real-time reporting dashboards
- References from past partners
- Clear exit provisions
- Performance guarantees or renegotiation clauses

### Red Flags (Universal Deal-Breakers)

1. **IP ownership transfer** — Any language about shared IP, sequel rights, or character licensing
2. **Vague recoupable costs** — "Other expenses" line items with no specifics
3. **No minimum guarantee with high revenue share** — 50% for no value or risk-sharing
4. **Automatic sequel/DLC rights** — Locked into future work at original terms
5. **Pressure to sign quickly** — "Limited time offer" or discouraging legal review

---

## Revenue Share Expectations

### Industry Benchmarks

| Entity | Typical Take |
|--------|-------------|
| App Stores (Apple/Google) | 30% (15% for <$1M/year) |
| Gaming Publishers (fair) | 30-40% |
| Gaming Publishers (exploitative) | 50-80% |
| EdTech Platforms | 30% (creator keeps 70%) |

### Developer Sentiment on 50/50

**Perception:** At the HIGH END of acceptable. Requires substantial justification.

**When 50/50 is accepted:**
- Partner provides significant upfront value (marketing budget, development support)
- Clear proof of revenue improvement capability (case studies)
- Developer retains 100% IP ownership
- Transparent reporting with audit rights
- Performance guarantees or renegotiation clauses

**When 50/50 is rejected:**
- No track record or case studies
- No upfront investment or risk-sharing
- Vague about what partner actually does
- IP ownership transfer or shared rights

### Recommendation for Moonshot

Use tiered revenue share structure:
- **Pilot period:** 70/30 (developer keeps 70%) for first 3-6 months
- **Growth phase:** 65/35 after demonstrating 2x revenue improvement
- **Scale phase:** 60/40 for mature partnerships
- **Guarantee:** "If we don't increase revenue by 100% in 6 months, terms renegotiate"

## Key Insights for Outreach

### Universal Truths (Research-Backed)

1. **Autonomy is #1** — Greater autonomy makes developers happier at work (Atlassian survey)
2. **All prefer partnership over acquisition** — They don't want to sell; they want passive income
3. **Trust is the biggest barrier** — Need track record, transparency, and easy exit options
4. **50/50 requires justification** — Industry standard is 70/30 (developer favor)
5. **Control concerns are paramount** — Fear of app quality degradation or unwanted changes

### Differentiated Messaging

**For Burned Out Solo Dev:**
> "You've been carrying this alone for too long. Hand off the burden and get your life back."

**For Accidental Success:**
> "You built something people love, but you're leaving money on the table. We'll monetize it thoughtfully."

**For Aspiring Entrepreneur:**
> "You're building a business, not just an app. Partner with us as your business co-founder."

**For Emerging Market Builder:**
