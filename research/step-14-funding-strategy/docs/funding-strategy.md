# Funding Strategy

## Executive Summary

**Recommendation: Bootstrap-First with $150K Personal Capital**

With $150K+ available and a preference for maintaining full ownership, Moonshot can reach proof-of-concept (2-3 profitable app partnerships) without external funding. The research validates that bootstrapped app portfolios consistently achieve profitability within 6-12 months with proper execution.

**Key Numbers:**
- Bootstrap runway: 2-3 apps with $150K
- Time to profitability per app: 3-6 months (with existing user base)
- Break-even portfolio: 3-5 apps at $3-5K net/app/month
- External funding trigger: Consider only after proven model with 3+ partnerships

---

## Option 1: Bootstrap (RECOMMENDED)

### Approach
- Start with $150K personal capital
- Launch first 2-3 app partnerships sequentially
- Reinvest 60-70% of profits into next partnerships
- Hire contractors, not employees initially
- Target profitability by Month 12-18

### Bootstrap Runway Analysis ($150K Starting Capital)

#### Scenario A: Conservative (Offshore Development)
| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| App 1 Development | $35,000 |
| App 2 Development | $35,000 |
| App 3 Development | $35,000 |
| Operational Reserve (12mo) | $25,000 |
| Legal/Admin (Year 1) | $3,000 |
| Tools/Infrastructure | $2,000 |
| **Total** | **$135,000** |
| **Remaining Buffer** | **$15,000** |

**Result:** 3 apps launched with 12-month runway buffer

#### Scenario B: Hybrid Team (Eastern Europe)
| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| App 1 Development | $50,000 |
| App 2 Development | $50,000 |
| Operational Reserve (12mo) | $30,000 |
| Legal/Admin (Year 1) | $3,000 |
| Tools/Infrastructure | $2,000 |
| **Total** | **$135,000** |
| **Remaining Buffer** | **$15,000** |

**Result:** 2 apps launched with quality team, 12-month runway

### Time to Profitability Model

**Assumptions:**
- Target apps: 100K MAU, currently $1K/mo revenue
- Monetization uplift: 4x (conservative)
- Revenue share: 70/30 pilot (developer keeps 70%)
- Ops costs: $200/mo per app

| Month | App 1 | App 2 | App 3 | Total Net |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|-----------|
| 1-3 | Build | - | - | -$35K |
| 4-6 | Optimize | Build | - | +$900/mo |
| 7-9 | Steady | Optimize | Build | +$1,800/mo |
| 10-12 | Steady | Steady | Optimize | +$2,700/mo |
| 13+ | Steady | Steady | Steady | +$2,700/mo |

**Cumulative cash flow:**
- Month 6: -$32K (still investing)
- Month 12: -$20K (approaching break-even)
- Month 18: +$16K (profitable, self-sustaining)
- Month 24: +$52K (ready for app 4-5 with profits)

### Pros
- Full ownership retained (100%)
- No investor pressure or reporting
- Forced discipline on unit economics
- Move deliberately, validate before scaling
- Keep optionality for future paths

### Cons
- Slower initial growth
- Personal financial risk
- May miss market timing if competitors emerge
- Limited ability to pursue multiple apps in parallel

### Capital Efficiency Best Practices

From successful bootstrapped app founders (Tony Dinh, Pieter Levels, Danny Postma):

1. **Build MVPs Fast:** 2-3 weeks per core feature set
2. **Ship at 70%:** Don't over-engineer before validation
3. **Eastern Europe Developers:** Best value/quality at $40-70/hr
4. **Use BaaS:** Firebase/Supabase free tiers cover 100K MAU
5. **Solo Operations:** Maintain until $10K+ MRR
6. **Audience Building:** Leverage Twitter/Reddit for free distribution
7. **Sequential Focus:** One major project at a time

## Option 2: Angel / Pre-Seed

### When to Consider
Only after:
- 2-3 successful partnerships (proof of model)
- $10K+ combined MRR from portfolio
- Clear case study with 3-5x monetization improvement
- Desire to accelerate growth significantly

### Approach
- Raise $250K-500K from aligned angels/micro-VCs
- Use for 5-10 additional app partnerships
- Prove scalability, then evaluate Series A

### Best-Fit Investors (Profit-Focused)

#### Tier 1: Perfect Alignment

| Investor | Check Size | Why They Fit |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| **Earnest Capital** | $200-300K | Shared Earnings Agreement, profit-first, bootstrapped SaaS focus |
| **Calm Company Fund** | $150-500K | "Early-stage value investing," sustainable businesses |
| **TinySeed** | $100-200K | Dividend-based returns, bootstrapped B2B focus |

#### Tier 2: Worth Exploring

| Investor | Check Size | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|
| Hustle Fund | $25-100K | Execution-focused, pre-seed |
| Backstage Capital | $25-100K | Underrepresented founders |
| Scott Belsky (Angel) | Varies | Product-focused, consumer apps |

### Pitch Focus for Angels
1. **Proven demand:** Under-monetized apps exist (347K+ target market)
2. **Clear unit economics:** $35-50K investment → $2K+/mo net revenue
3. **Differentiated model:** Partnership, not acquisition (developer keeps IP)
4. **White space:** No direct competitor in non-gaming mobile apps
5. **Founder-market fit:** Technical + business execution capability

### Dilution Considerations
- Earnest Capital: No equity (Shared Earnings Agreement - repay 2-5x from profits)
- TinySeed: Dividend-based (equity but profit-aligned)
- Traditional angels: 10-20% equity typical for $250-500K

### Pros
- Faster scaling capability
- Network and expertise access
- Validation signal for future rounds/partnerships

### Cons
- Dilution (varies by structure)
- Investor expectations and reporting
- Time spent fundraising (2-4 months typical)
- May push toward growth over profitability

## Option 3: Revenue-Based Financing (RBF)

### When to Consider
- After reaching $15K+ MRR across portfolio
- Need growth capital without equity dilution
- Want to accelerate app acquisition pace

### Best-Fit Providers

| Provider | Amount | Min Revenue | Fit |
|----------|--------|-------------|-----|
| **Lighter Capital** | Up to $4M | $15K MRR | HIGH - Lowest threshold |
| Capchase | $25K-$10M | $1M ARR | MEDIUM - Later stage |
| Pipe | Varies | Subscription revenue | MEDIUM - Complex structure |
| Clearco | Up to $20M | $10K/mo | MEDIUM - E-commerce focus |

### Terms to Expect
- Repayment: 1.3x-2x of capital borrowed
- Timeline: 2-8% of monthly revenue until repaid
- No equity, no personal guarantees
- Approval: 1-4 weeks

### Pros
- No dilution
- Aligned with recurring revenue model
- Flexible repayment based on performance
- Fast access to capital

### Cons
- Need existing revenue to qualify
- Higher effective cost than equity (1.3-2x)
- Cash flow pressure if revenue dips
- B2B SaaS focus may require creative framing

## Option 4: Accelerators

### Not Recommended for Moonshot Model

| Accelerator | Investment | Equity | Why Not Fit |
|-------------|------------|--------|-------------|
| Y Combinator | $500K | 7% | Growth-at-all-costs pressure |
| Techstars | $220K | 5% | Similar growth expectations |
| 500 Global | $150-250K | Varies | High-growth focus |

### Exceptions Worth Exploring

| Program | Investment | Equity | Why Consider |
|---------|------------|--------|--------------|
| **Google for Startups: Apps** | $0 (credits + mentorship) | 0% | Equity-free, app-focused |
| Apple Entrepreneur Camp | $0 | 0% | Equity-free, requires diversity criteria |

## Recommended Path: Phased Approach

### Phase 1: Bootstrap Proof of Concept (Months 1-12)
**Capital:** $150K personal funds
**Goal:** 2-3 successful partnerships, $5-10K MRR

**Activities:**
- Month 1-3: First partnership signed and in development
- Month 4-6: First app live, monetization optimizations
- Month 7-9: Second partnership, document case study
- Month 10-12: Third partnership, reach break-even

**Success Metrics:**
- 3 apps generating revenue
- Combined $5K+ net MRR to Moonshot
- At least one 3x+ monetization case study
- Playbook documented and repeatable

### Phase 2: Decide Growth Path (Month 12-15)

**If Proven Model + Want to Scale Faster:**
- Approach Earnest Capital or Calm Fund ($200-500K)
- Or use Lighter Capital RBF if at $15K+ MRR
- Target: 5-10 apps by Month 24

**If Proven Model + Prefer Sustainable Growth:**
- Continue bootstrapped, reinvest profits
- Add 1-2 apps per year from cash flow
- Target: 5-7 apps by Month 36

**If Model Not Working:**
- Evaluate learnings, pivot or wind down
- Personal capital preserved for next venture
- No external obligations to manage

### Phase 3: Scale or Stay Small (Month 18+)

**Option A: Aggressive Scale**
- Raise $500K-$1M from aligned investors
- Build small team (3-5 people)
- Target 15-20 apps by Year 3
- Consider Series A if venture-scale opportunity

**Option B: Profitable Lifestyle Business**
- Stay at 5-10 apps generating $50-100K/year net
- Solo or 1-2 person operation
- High margins, low stress, full ownership
- "Calm company" model

**Option C: Exit**
- Sell portfolio to strategic acquirer
- App studio M&A exists (Tripledot paid $800M for AppLovin portfolio)
- Typical multiples: 3-5x annual revenue
