```

**Step 2: Follow-up DM (after engagement)**
```
Hey [Name], thanks for responding to my comment on your [App Name] post.

Really impressed by what you've built - [specific detail about the app].

I'm exploring partnerships with indie devs who have strong apps but limited time for monetization. Would you be open to a quick chat about how that might work for [App Name]?

No pressure either way - just thought your app would be a great fit.

### r/androiddev / r/iOSProgramming - After Credibility Building

**DM Template (only after commenting history)**
```
Hey [Name], I've been following your posts in r/[subreddit] - really appreciated your insights on [specific topic].

I noticed you mentioned [monetization challenge / time constraints] with [App Name]. I'm working on something that might help - a partnership model where we handle monetization while you keep ownership.

Would you be open to hearing more? Totally understand if not - just wanted to reach out since you seemed like a great fit.
```

### r/AppBusiness - Direct Participation

**Forum Post Response**
```
This is a really common challenge. A few things that have worked:

1. [Genuine insight about their problem]
2. [Second helpful point]

One other option worth considering: partnering with someone who specializes in app monetization. It's a less common path but can work well if you want to stay focused on product.

Happy to share more details if you're curious.

## Twitter/X Templates

### Cold DM (After Engagement)

**Template A: Reference Specific Tweet**
```
Hey [Name], saw your tweet about [specific topic] - really resonated with me.

[App Name] looks like exactly the kind of app that could benefit from better monetization. I help indie devs turn under-monetized apps into revenue machines through a partnership model (you keep ownership, we share revenue).

Would you be open to a 15-min call to see if it could work?
```

**Template B: Build in Public Reference**
```
Hey! Been following your #buildinpublic journey with [App Name] - love the transparency.

I noticed you're at [X users] but revenue is still [low/growing slowly]. I specialize in exactly this - helping indie apps unlock their monetization potential through partnerships.

Would a quick chat be useful? No sales pitch, just want to learn about your situation.
```

**Template C: Monetization Struggle Response**
```
Saw your tweet about struggling with [specific issue]. Been there.

I'm building something that might help - a partnership where we handle monetization/growth for indie apps while you keep ownership. You keep 70% of revenue.

Worth a 10-min call? Even if it's not a fit, happy to share what I've learned about [their category] monetization.
```

### Reply to Tweets

**On Monetization Posts**
```
This is so relatable. Have you considered partnering with someone to handle the monetization side? It's a less common path but can work really well for apps with strong user bases but limited revenue.
```

**On User Milestone Posts**
```
Congrats on [X users]! That's a real accomplishment.

Curious - are you seeing revenue scale with the users, or is monetization still a work in progress?
```

## Indie Hackers Templates

### Forum Comment
```
Great progress on [App Name]! Love seeing mobile apps here.

One thing I've noticed with apps in the [X to Y user] range - there's often a big gap between what they're earning and what they could earn with proper monetization. Have you explored different revenue models?

I'm working on a partnership program for exactly this situation - happy to share insights if useful.
```

### Direct Message

**Template A: Revenue-Focused**
```
Hey [Name], found your profile while researching mobile apps on IH.

[App Name] looks awesome - [specific compliment]. I noticed you're at [X MRR] with [Y users]. In my experience, apps with that user count can often 5-10x revenue with the right monetization strategy.

I'm building Moonshot - we partner with indie devs to handle monetization while you keep ownership. Would you be open to a quick chat to see if it could work?

Either way, love what you're building.
```

**Template B: Time-Constrained Dev**
```
Hey [Name], saw your post about balancing [App Name] with [job/family/other projects].

I get it - monetization takes a ton of time that could go to product. That's actually why I'm reaching out.

I'm exploring partnerships where we handle the monetization/business side for indie apps, while the developer keeps ownership and earns 50% of revenue.

Would that kind of arrangement interest you? No pressure - just thought you'd be a good fit given what you shared.

Subject: Partnership opportunity for [App Name]

**Subject:** How indie apps are 10x-ing revenue without selling

```
Hi [Name],

I've been researching indie mobile apps that have strong user bases but limited revenue. [App Name] caught my attention because [specific reason].

The pattern I keep seeing: developers with 15K-1M users leaving 5-20x revenue on the table due to poor monetization. Apps similar to yours in [category] typically earn $[X] per 1K users - you might be well below that.

I'm building partnerships to fix this. We handle monetization, you keep ownership, we split revenue.

**Subject:** Guest pitch: The indie app monetization gap

```
Hi [Host Name],

I've been a listener of [Podcast Name] for a while and love [specific episode/topic].

I'm reaching out because I've been researching a pattern that I think would resonate with your audience: indie apps with 15K-1M users that leave 5-20x revenue on the table.

I've compiled data on:
- Why 82.8% of apps earn <$1K/month
- The monetization gap between ad-only and subscription models
- Real examples of apps that improved revenue without growing users

I'd love to share these insights with your listeners. I'm building Moonshot, a partnership model for under-monetized apps, but happy to keep the conversation educational rather than promotional.

Would this be a fit for [Podcast Name]?

Best,
[Your name]

## Best Practices

### Personalization is Critical
- **Generic templates will be ignored**
- Reference specific features, reviews, or public posts
- Show you've actually used or researched their app
- Mention specific metrics they've shared

### Keep It Short
- Initial outreach: < 100 words
- First DM: 2-3 sentences max
- Respect their time

### Lead with Value
- Don't pitch immediately
- Offer insights or ask genuine questions first
- Position yourself as helpful, not salesy

### Timing Matters
- DM within 24-48 hours of their post/tweet
- Engage before DMing
- Don't message on weekends (lower response rates)

### Avoid Common Mistakes
- Don't mention specific revenue numbers until qualification call
- Don't copy-paste identical messages
- Don't DM without any prior engagement (on Reddit/Discord)
- Don't be pushy - two follow-ups max, then stop
