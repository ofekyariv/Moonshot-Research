**Research Date:** December 29, 2025
**Full Report:** `/Users/ofek/moonshot/research/market/competitive-update-dec2025.html`

---

## Executive Summary

### Market Validation: STRONG
- **Non-gaming apps surpassed mobile games in revenue for the first time in Q2 2025**
  - Non-gaming: $21.1B (+24% YoY)
  - Gaming: $20B (0% growth)
  - This represents a historic shift in the app economy

### Competitive Threat: HIGH but MANAGEABLE
- **Tilting Point** has officially entered non-gaming with $30M deployed (December 2025)
- However, they only provide UA funding - no operational partnership

### Key Finding: Clear Differentiation
- No competitor offers full-stack operational partnership model
- All focus on either: UA funding only, acquisition, or gaming-only publishing
- **Moonshot's combination remains unique:** Tech rewrite + Monetization + Ops + Revenue share (no acquisition)

---

## 1. CRITICAL THREAT: Tilting Point

### What They Did
- **March 2025:** Announced $150M UA fund (gaming + non-gaming)
- **December 2025:** First non-gaming deals deployed
  - $12M to Clean Manager (utility app by Quiet)
  - $18M to undisclosed lifestyle app
  - Total: $30M/year in non-gaming

### Their Model
- **Non-dilutive financing:** Developers retain ownership
- **Revenue-tied repayment:** Repay from UA campaign revenue
- **What they DON'T provide:**
  - ❌ No technical overhaul or code rewrites
  - ❌ No operational support (legal, accounting, infrastructure)
  - ❌ No revenue optimization beyond UA spend
  - ❌ No analytics implementation or monetization strategy

### Competitive Analysis
- **Threat Level:** HIGH - First mover with $150M capital
- **Differentiation:** Moonshot offers full operational partnership vs capital-only
- **Opportunity:** Their model creates demand for our services - developers who get funding but lack capacity to deploy it effectively

---

## 2. Gaming Publishers: No Movement

### Status Check
- **CrazyLabs:** Still gaming-only (55% rev share, 1 in 150-200 acceptance)
- **Voodoo:** No non-gaming announcements
- **Supersonic:** Launched self-serve platform for games only

### Analysis
- **Threat Level:** MEDIUM
- Only Tilting Point made the leap despite non-gaming market > gaming
- Suggests execution challenges or strategic hesitation

## 3. New Entrants

### PvX Partners (NEW)
- **Recent Deal:** €15.2M to Reface (AI app) for UA growth
- **Model:** Revenue-based financing, 12-24 month draw period
- **Scale:** $250M+ committed in UA facilities
- **Similar to Tilting Point:** UA funding only, no ops

### Tiny
- **Status:** No mobile app focus
- Acquires SaaS/web products ($500K-$50M profit requirement)
- NOT targeting mobile apps

### Flippa / Acquire.com / Empire Flippers
- **Model:** Acquisition marketplaces
- Transaction platforms, not operational partners
- Different buyer pool (passive income seekers, not operators)

## 6. Threats & Opportunities

### Active Threats

**Threat 1: Tilting Point Market Education**
- Risk: Their $150M creates awareness, may dominate developer mindshare
- Impact: HIGH
- Mitigation: Position as "operational partner" vs "UA funder"

**Threat 2: UA Funding Commoditization**
- Risk: Multiple UA funders emerge, price competition
- Impact: MEDIUM
- Mitigation: Moonshot's value is execution, not capital

### Emerging Opportunities

**Opportunity 1: Partner with UA Funders**
- Developers getting Tilting Point/PvX funding need tech + ops support
- Strategic Play: "You got the money - we'll build the engine"
- Turns Tilting Point from competitor to lead generation

**Opportunity 2: Market Timing Validated**
- Non-gaming > gaming + Tilting Point pivot = validation
- Use for fundraising narrative

**Opportunity 3: White Space in Operational Partnerships**
- No competitor offers full-stack partnership
- Only Moonshot addresses: retain ownership + lack capacity to scale

---

## 7. Strategic Recommendations

### 1. Reposition Against Tilting Point
- **Action:** Update messaging to contrast with UA-only models
- **Positioning:** "UA funding gives you fuel. Moonshot builds the engine, optimizes the route, and drives the car."
- **Target:** Developers with technical debt, poor analytics, unclear monetization

### 2. Move Fast on Pilot ⚡
- **Urgency:** HIGH - Tilting Point actively deploying capital
- **Action:** Prioritize Step 13 (pilot selection)
- **Timeline:** Q1 2026 completion = proven alternative before Tilting Point scales

### 3. Monitor Tilting Point Portfolio
- **Action:** Track Clean Manager + lifestyle app metrics
- **Why:** If UA-only shows limitations, validates Moonshot's holistic approach
- **Tools:** Sensor Tower, data.ai, AppAnnie

### 4. Leverage Market Data in Outreach
- **Talking Point:** "Non-gaming overtook games in Q2 2025 ($21.1B vs $20B). Major publishers are pivoting. This is the moment."
- **Credibility:** Cite Tilting Point as validation, position Moonshot as comprehensive

### 5. Target Apps Rejected by UA Funders
- **Insight:** UA funders require high ROAS/retention. Many good apps won't meet bar.
- **Moonshot Advantage:** Fix tech + monetization first, UA-ready later
- **Segment:** Strong concept/users but poor execution

## Final Assessment

| Metric | Rating | Details |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **Market Validation** | ✅ STRONG | Non-gaming > games + Tilting Point validates thesis |
| **Competitive Threat** | ⚠️ HIGH but MANAGEABLE | Tilting Point is first mover, limited to UA only |
| **Differentiation** | ✅ CLEAR | Full-stack operational partnership remains unique |
| **Window of Opportunity** | ⏰ 6-12 months | Establish POC before market crowded |
| **Strategic Imperative** | 🚀 EXECUTE FAST | Prove superior results vs UA-only approach |

### Recommendation: PROCEED with heightened urgency

Competitive landscape validates opportunity while creating time pressure. Moonshot's operational model is defensible, but must prove value quickly to capture market share before UA funders evolve or gaming publishers enter.
