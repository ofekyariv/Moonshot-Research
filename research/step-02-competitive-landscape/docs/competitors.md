# Competitive Landscape

## Executive Summary

The mobile app partnership/acquisition space is dominated by **gaming-focused players**. Major consolidators (AppLovin, Supersonic, Voodoo, CrazyLabs) exclusively target hyper-casual and casual gaming. Holding companies (Tiny) focus on SaaS/web businesses. E-commerce aggregators (OpenStore) target Shopify stores.

**Key Finding:** No established player targets non-gaming indie mobile apps with a partnership (vs. acquisition) model. This represents Moonshot's primary white space opportunity.

## White Space Opportunities for Moonshot

### 1. **Vertical Gap: Non-Gaming Mobile Apps**
The gaming publishing ecosystem is mature with established players. But utility, education, lifestyle, and productivity apps have **no equivalent support infrastructure**.

**Evidence:**
- Tilting Point's 2025 pivot validates market opportunity
- Non-gaming apps now exceed gaming in total app store revenue
- Users spend 90% of mobile time in non-gaming categories
- Gaming publishers explicitly exclude non-gaming apps

### 2. **Model Gap: Partnership vs. Acquisition**
All existing players are **acquirers** (even those with "publishing" models take significant control):
- Tiny, OpenStore: Full acquisition
- Supersonic, Voodoo: Effectively take control of game
- CrazyLabs "Publishing For All": Developer keeps ownership but low-value games only

**Moonshot Opportunity:** True partnership where developer keeps meaningful ownership and optional involvement, while getting operational lift.

### 3. **Service Gap: Technical + Monetization Combined**
- Gaming publishers: Focus on UA and ads, no technical rebuild
- Holding companies: No operational involvement
- E-commerce aggregators: Operations but no technical modernization
- Tilting Point (non-gaming): UA funding only, no technical/monetization support

**Moonshot Opportunity:** Full-stack service (technical rebuild + monetization optimization) that gaming publishers provide, but for non-gaming apps.

### 4. **Developer Experience Gap**
Gaming publishers optimize for volume and LTV:
- Accept 1 in 150-200 games
- Focus on hyper-casual with $0.50-$1.50 LTV
- Treat developers as content suppliers

**Moonshot Opportunity:** Developer-centric partnership with:
- Higher acceptance rate for qualifying apps
- Focus on sustainable subscription/IAP revenue (not just ads)
- Genuine partnership relationship

## Competitive Threats

### Immediate Threats
1. **Tilting Point's Expansion** - First mover in non-gaming app investment
   - Mitigation: They offer UA funding only, not operational partnership
   - Our differentiation: Full technical + monetization support

2. **Gaming Publishers Expanding** - If CrazyLabs/Voodoo decide to enter non-gaming
   - Mitigation: Their DNA is hyper-casual gaming; different skill set required
   - Our differentiation: Understanding of non-gaming monetization models

### Medium-Term Threats
3. **New Entrants** - Moonshot's model could be replicated
   - Mitigation: Build portfolio and playbook early
   - First-mover advantage in relationships

4. **Developer Self-Service** - Tools making monetization easier
   - Mitigation: Tools alone don't fix under-monetization; expertise required

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **No direct competitor** offers partnership + operational lift for non-gaming indie mobile apps
2. **Tilting Point is closest threat** but offers funding, not partnership
3. **Acquisition models dominate** - partnership model is genuinely differentiated
4. **Market timing is favorable** - non-gaming apps now larger than gaming by revenue
5. **Gaming playbook exists** - can adapt Supersonic/CrazyLabs partnership models for non-gaming
